<h1>Hello and welcome</h1>
<h2> Running the app:</h2>

<p>First step is to clone the repo.</p>

<p>Go to the dir where you have the downloaded folder.</p>

<p>You must be running Python 3 to develop on this project. Run python --version and ensure that the print out is 3.x.x (usually it will be 3.6.x). If you see version 2, then try to repeat the command above with python3 --version. If this second approach worked for you then please read the whole of the next paragraph before creating your virtual environment.</p>

<p>Activate the virtual environment with the following code in Command Prompt (Flask does not work in Powershell) in the top level of the repo: venv\Scripts\activate. You should see (venv) appear at the beginning of the next line in your Command Prompt.</p>

<p>To deactivate later, run deactivate. The (venv) should dissapear.</p>

<p>Run the command set FLASK_APP=app.py to set the FLASK_APP environment variable.</p>

<p>Run the command set FLASK_DEBUG=1 during development to make sure your flask application reloads when you make changes.</p>

<p>Run flask run to run the webserver and visit localhost:5000 to see it in action. Now you can get to work.</p>
